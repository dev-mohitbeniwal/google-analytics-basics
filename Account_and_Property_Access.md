# Account and Property Access

In GA4, you can have multiple accounts. Each account can contain up to 100 properties, and each property can have up to 50 data streams. You can set permissions both at the account and at the property level.

## Setting up Access

-   **Single User:** Add a single user by typing their email, choosing their role, and deciding if they will have access to cost and revenue metrics.
-   **Groups:** You can also add groups within the same organization.

## Roles and Permissions

Roles start from:

1. **None:** The user has a role in another resource but not this one.
2. **Viewer:** The user can view data.
3. **Analyst:** The user can work on explorations.
4. **Marketer:** The user can create audiences, conversions, and events.
5. **Editor:** The user has full control at the property level.
6. **Admin:** The user has complete control. All roles can do anything the tier below them can.
