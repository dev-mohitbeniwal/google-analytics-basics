# Cost per Conversion and Attribution Models

## Cost per Conversion

To determine the most profitable channels for ad expenditure, we need to understand our cost per conversion for each channel. This involves calculating the total expenditure, including salaries, taxes, and project costs, and dividing this by the traffic for that month. For channels like Google Ads, the ROI can be easily viewed, however for offline or non-instantaneous feedback channels, we need careful estimation.

In managing ad budget distribution and ROI values, we advocate for simple philosophy. If the ROI is greater than one, we increase the budget. If the ROI is close to one, we continue tweaking the campaign â€“ changing ad copy, images, keywords, landing pages etc. However, if the results are poor, we identify it as an unsuccessful channel.

By shifting focus from default channel group to campaign, we can use campaign data tags to identify successful campaigns, understand reasons behind success and replicate those actions.

## Attribution Models and Conversion Paths

Understanding Attribution Models and Conversion Paths is vital. Since a user may interact with multiple ads and sources before a conversion, it's important to understand the credit distribution across these touchpoints. Different attribution models attempt to quantify this process.

1. **Rule-based models**
    - Cross-channel last click: All credit given to the last clicked channel.
    - Cross-channel first click: All credit given to the first clicked channel.
    - Cross-channel linear: Credit is distributed evenly across all touchpoints.
    - Cross-channel time decay: More credit is given to the touchpoints closer to the conversion.
    - Cross-channel position based: 40% credit is given to both first and last channels and 20% to all others.
2. **Data-driven attribution**: Google uses machine learning to evaluate and credit touchpoints.
3. **Ads preferred last click**: Conversion credit is given to the last Google Ads channel a customer used.

All models exclude direct visits from receiving attribution credit unless all touchpoints are direct visits. We can change property attribution settings from the Admin section and also determine how far back a touchpoint can receive credit. We use this data to better understand user journeys and manage our efforts and budget accordingly.

We focus more on the initial touchpoints for gaining new users as they represent the source of user discovery.

By understanding how our users journey from discovery to conversion and estimating the cost per conversion, we can better optimize our ad expenditure across different channels.
