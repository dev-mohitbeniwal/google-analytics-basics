# Data Settings

Data settings in GA4 focus on data collection, data retention, and data filters.

## Data Collection

Our recommendation is to always have Google Signals turned on. This allows for ad personalization and gives insights on your audiences.

## Data Retention

By default, data retention is set to 2 months. However, you can set it to 14 months.

## Data Filters

Data filters allow you to include or exclude event data. Remember they don't apply to historical data and once set, you can't get that data back.
