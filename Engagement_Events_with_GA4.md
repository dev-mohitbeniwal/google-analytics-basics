# Engagement Events with GA4

In Google Analytics 4 (GA4), we use an event-based measurement system to track user interactions. Events can be divided into four categories:

-   Automatically collected events
-   Enhanced measurement events
-   Recommended events
-   Custom events

Automatically collected and enhanced measurement events require no additional technical skills or product integrations. In contrast, recommended and custom events need integrations with Google Tag Manager and might need help from a developer.

## Navigating Events

The list of all events being tracked by GA4 is available at support.google.com/analytics. We use events as if they were lego pieces, using automatically collected and enhanced measurement events as the standard predefined shapes. Recommended events are harder to find, and custom events may need specific creations or custom definitions.

Understanding your organization's objectives will help determine the relevant events to focus on. Based on your goals, you can use events data to inspect user behavior, from basic events like page views to specific actions such as making a purchase.

## Conversions

Conversions are events that denote important user interactions. Creating a conversion from an event requires marking an event as a conversion in the Events section of Admin. Conversions are significant because:

-   They help track what's valuable for your organization
-   They can be used to bid on actual conversions when GA4 is integrated with Google Ads
-   They help with attribution where multiple channels contribute to a conversion

## Pages and Screens

Pages and screens provide insights into user sessions and engagement rates, though other sections in GA4 might provide more insightful ways to analyze this data.
