Key reminders are:

1. **Extend your learning**: Feel free to find more about ecommerce measures for GA4 at the given link or via searches. Connect with online communities, join discussions in forums, reddit groups, or in the comment section of related blog posts and YouTube videos. This way, you update yourself with product changes and solutions.

2. **The purpose of GA4**: Avoid piling up data without making evidenced-based decisions. Consider whether the report design is serving its intended purpose. All the stats represent people; remember you are studying human behaviour.

3. **Reflection and practice** : Spend time with the Realtime report, engage with the user snapshot feature and put yourself in the shoes of an actual visitor on your site. Practice as much as possible; remember, experience outdoes theoretical knowledge. However, you might need professional help to set things up properly.

4. **Take strides** : Experiment, fail, but keep trying till you master using GA4 effectively.
