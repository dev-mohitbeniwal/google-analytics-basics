# GA4 Acquisition and Traffic Sources

GA4 Acquisition reports show session-driven dimensions, which contains data about a user's interaction with our website until 30 minutes of inactivity. We can interpret this data using two primary views, the user default channel group (the initial interaction on the website) and the session default channel group (the most recent interaction).

We can also investigate GA4 data using a segmentation method that involves examining our traffic sources in detail. This method allows us to zoom in (to view specific traffic sources like Instagram or Facebook) or zoom out (to view traffic channels or mediums like search, CPC, paid ads, email, or direct traffic).

Depending on your role within our organization, interactions with GA4 data differ. For example, chief marketing officers might find more value in evaluating the contributions of each channel than examining individual keywords or sites for traffic. Middle managers could use this information to compare Google Ad campaign results, identify successful subordinates, and provide feedback accordingly.
