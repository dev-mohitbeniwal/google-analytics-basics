# GA4 User Stickiness

User stickiness helps identify how well we retain users over time. Generally, a high ratio is desirable. For example, if we compare the daily active users to monthly active users, we get a percentage of repeat users. This metric is critical for ascertaining loyal users, their likelihood of recommending our product or service to others, and their lifetime value to our organization. Evaluating this metric, particularly after significant business decisions, can provide invaluable insights into our customer relationships.
