# Going Pro

## Course Summary

In the past hours, we've covered the new event centered perspective of Google Analytics 4 (GA4), allowing comprehensive user tracking across devices. We've addressed the importance of user privacy, platform changes, regulation, and how these elements shape web analytics.

After setting up and testing your GA4 property, we explored the main activities: monitoring, investigating, and understanding data. Our journey took us through report snapshots, realtime data, acquisition, engagement, user demographics, and technology. Throughout this process, we dissected segmentation methods, time period comparisons, adding filters and secondary dimensions, and traffic source data analysis.

Next, we delved into explorations of data, how to create your custom funnels, error fixes with path exploration, and audience analysis via segment overlaps.

In the advertising module, we covered channel performance, attribution models, with comparison of conversion data and ecommerce tracking setup for improved conversion rates.

During the configuration module, we created audiences for Google Analytics marketing, constructed recommended events, and added ecommerce tracking. We also set up a custom event to monitor user behavior.

Finally, in the admin section, we discussed user roles management, and the benefits of linking GA4 to other products.

## Moving Forward

With GA4 becoming an industry standard, your first resource should be the Analytics Help Center. This provides concise information on events, parameters, dimensions and metrics vital to GA4.

Spend time with the demo account to familiarize yourself with GA4's features, and consider learning Google Tag Manager (GTM), which increases GA4's functionality.

Lastly, bookmark the Google Analytics Developer Guides for useful insights and guidelines.

Note: Embrace this learning curve and leverage it to understand your audiences better and drive your digital strategies to success.
