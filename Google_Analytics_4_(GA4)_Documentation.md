# Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Documentation

## Paid and Organic Traffic Analysis

We found that paid search strategy is more effective for our elderly users. In comparison, our younger audience predominantly reaches us through organic search.

-   We suggested creating a specific ad group attuned to elderly folks in our paid search campaign.
-   For the younger audience reaching us organically, we considered focusing on creating more relevant content.

Be cautious when interpreting data, as it might reflect our past focus areas, and not necessarily users' preferences. Events like 90% organic vs. 10% social media could indicate potential under-explored opportunities, such as social media, for example.

## Tech Data for Development Team

Tech data provides useful insights for our dev team on user's devices, platforms, operating systems, browsers, and screen resolution.

-   This data helps test and prioritize new functionalities based on the most popular used tech among our users.
-   Overlaying tech data with other events like engagement rates or session duration helps us identify interface errors.

## Exploring GA4: Templates, Techniques, and Use Cases

Exploration in GA4 is like creating comprehensive reports; however, a few points to remember:

-   Data coverage in explorations is limited to our set data retention settings.
-   Sometimes results may differ between reports and explorations - in this case, Google's recommendation is to trust exploration results.

Explorations provide a way to explore our data with different characteristics and levels of granularity based on custom requirements. It consists of three sections:

### Variables Section

At the left side where we add all the data we plan on working with. This section has the data for:

-   The period for the analysis.
-   Segments for applying various conditions.
-   Dimensions and metrics from the Variables tab.

### Tab Settings

This is where we build our exploration. We drag segments, dimensions, and metrics from the Variables tab and customize our data until we reach the goal of our investigation.

### Exploration Result

The right side of the screen will display the results of our analyses.

To start building an exploration:

1. Set the period for the analysis.
2. Import the required dimensions and metrics from the Variables tab.
3. Drag and drop these to the Tab settings area for analysis.

Remember to give your exploration a proper name and share it with everyone with access to the property.
