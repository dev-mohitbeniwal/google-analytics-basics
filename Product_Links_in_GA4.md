# Product Links in GA4

Linking GA4 accounts to other products provides several benefits.

## Google Ads Account

Linking your Google Ads account to GA4 enables you to see your ad campaigns in the acquisition and advertising sections, use the ads preferred to last-click attribution model, import conversion data for bidding, and use remarketing with GA4 created audiences. It is important to have administrative access to the service you want to connect to GA4.

However, besides Google Ads, most other services offer increased functionality to themselves and not to GA4. For instance, linking GA4 with Google Search Console offers only two new reports that are unpublished by default.

In conclusion, always make sure you're linking the correct GA4 account and other services to avail the desired benefits.
