# Segment Overlap

Access Segment Overlap by navigating to 'Explore -> Template gallery -> Segment overlap'. This technique helps identify specific user behaviors and understand segment ratios better, thus giving more in-depth insights into our user data.

Here's a step by step guide to using Segment Overlap exploration:

1. Create three segments: Mobile traffic, Age 18-34, and Age 35-54.
2. Edit existing segments by clicking the three dots on the right side and change demographic parameters.
3. Test hypotheses like "younger people are more likely to be mobile users" right within GA4.

An overlap of behavior and demographics, achievable by segment overlap, leads to substantial insights. Practice is all you need to master this tool.
