# Setting Up Google Analytics

The setup process will walk you through creating a GA4 property and linking it to your site or app.

## Account Structure and Tracking Methods

Under a single Google account, there's a hierarchy of multiple GA4 properties. A single GA4 account can relate to multiple properties (either Universal Analytics or GA4 properties). Keep in mind that a GA4 property uses an event-based model and can gather data from both web and apps. The key takeaway is that the old Universal Analytics measured sessions, whereas GA4 measures events.
