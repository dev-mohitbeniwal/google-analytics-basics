# Setup Prerequisites

Here is what you need before setting up GA4:

1. **Google Account:** All GA4 accounts require a Google Account. You can create one with any existing email address.

2. **Website/App Access:** You need access to the website/app you want to track.

3. **Access to Google Account/Tag Manager:** If setting up tracking for a client, you need access to their account or Tag Manager.

4. **DNS propagation:** If setting up tracking right after buying a domain, ensure DNS changes are propagated across the web.
