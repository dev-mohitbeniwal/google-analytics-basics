# Understanding Reports

This section helps us understand how to interpret Google Analytics 4 reports for better analytics and decision making.

## Reporting Overview & Segmentation

1. Initially, we might not have much data. You can practice using Googleâ€™s GA4 demo account.
2. Monitor and understand visitor behaviour with GA4.
3. Review the 'Report Snapshot' section for a comprehensive view of our traffic and user acquisition data.
4. Review 'Acquisition', 'Engagement', 'Monetization', 'Demographics' sections for specific insights.

## Real-Time Section

1. Use the 'Real-Time' section to monitor the recent status of our site.
2. Use the 'View Users Snapshot' feature to understand user behaviour. The feature randomly selects a user and provides a sequence of their actions on our website.

In the next module, we will delve deeper into reports and aim to gather valuable insights from the collected data.
