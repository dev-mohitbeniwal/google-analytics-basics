# Undervalued Channels: How to Identify

1. To identify undervalued channels and mediums as a source of new users, we use attribution model comparisons.
2. We find the increase or decrease in conversions based on different models, and channels that see increased conversions in first-click attribution compared to last-click attribution are potentially undervalued.
3. For instance, if Email and Organic Social show higher conversions with the first-click model than the last click, it indicates that these channels are being undervalued despite introducing the brand.
