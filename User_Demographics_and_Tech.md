# User Demographics and Tech

User demographics and tech information encompasses metrics such as country, region, city, gender, language, and interests. This data is crucial for forming a comprehensive understanding of your users in conducting detailed analytics.

For example, to understand your customers' age groups better, you can click the 'age ranges' card. Based on the tracked data, you can make decisions and assess whether the data is statistically accurate or not.

Combining multiple dimensions such as traffic channels and new users for each age group can provide more in-depth insights, helping hone your marketing efforts.
