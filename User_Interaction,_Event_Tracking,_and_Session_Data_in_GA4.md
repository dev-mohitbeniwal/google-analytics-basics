# User Interaction, Event Tracking, and Session Data in GA4

In GA4, user interactions on your site are tracked as events. These events include actions like page views, clicks, scrolling, and more. Sessions end after 30 minutes of inactivity. Therefore, if a user interacts with our platforms (say, first from a phone, then from a PC, and makes a purchase from a different device), through different touchpoints in a day, it enables us to track that same user across these touchpoints.

Nonetheless, it's vital we respect privacy policies and avoid tracking personal identifiable information (PII). That's why most IDs are generated as random strings or numbers.
