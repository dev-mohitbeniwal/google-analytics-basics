# Why Use Google Analytics 4

This section will help you understand the necessity and advantages of using Google Analytics 4. We don't intend to merely demonstrate its features but teach you how to leverage this tool to drive your decision-making process. We will focus not only on the knowledge but also on the wisdom it offers for improving your business strategies.

With the introduction of Google Analytics 4 (GA4), it's no longer a tool that can be used right out of the box without technical skills. For advanced GA4 features, we recommend collaboration with a developer proficient in Google Tag Manager and JavaScript. However, we will provide the principles, instructions, and resources for you to learn and implement things independently, even for these complex aspects.

While user privacy and regulations have limited certain analytical strategies, we'll focus our time on maximizing the potential of available analytical capabilities. We will emphasize event-based reporting, cross-device reporting, compelling attribution modeling, and unique, customized reporting. Our aim is to turn you from a GA4 dabbler into a GA4 pro.
